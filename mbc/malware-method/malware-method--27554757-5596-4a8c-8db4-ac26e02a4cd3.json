Manual symbol resolution is then used to access and execute the exported function. This method is often used by shellcode because it reduces the size of each import from a human-readable string to a sequence of four bytes. The Method is also known as \"Imports by Hash\" and \"GET_APIS_WITH_CRC.\" [1] This method is related to Unprotect technique U0217.",
