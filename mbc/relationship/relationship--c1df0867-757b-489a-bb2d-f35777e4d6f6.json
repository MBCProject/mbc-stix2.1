The API address returned from the function is stored into a global variance. API calls are obfuscated in the same manner as the stack strings and are resolved dynamically as the malware needs to use them. The malware encodes data in a stack string and copies that data into a global character buffer as a form of string obfuscation. [1] [2]",
